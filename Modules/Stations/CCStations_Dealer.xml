					<FoundingInfo
							desc=	"Cabbage Corp was founded shortly after the stock market crash of 1929.  Our founder was going into New York city to deliver a truck full of cabbages when a stock broker committed himself to an act of auto-defenestration and landed on the truck, ruining the cabbages.  This was not by any means the first time this had happened, but our founder cried out that it would be the last.  He then devoted the rest his life to creating one company to rule them all, and thus Cabbage Corp was founded.">

					<FirstDaysInfo
							desc=	"After taking the stock broker's wallet, keys and shoes as recompense, our founder proceeded to find his home and ransack it for books on various business practices and general economics stuff.  He then realized that it would be too hard to develop his own products, so he focused his efforts on stealing information from other companies while they were still distracted by news of the stock market crash.  After realizing what most of the records were about, he then proceeded to blackmail every public official in the state.">

					<FirstYearsInfo
							desc=	"A few months later, after finishing negotiations with the president and congress about stopping all of the blackmail, our founder had managed to acquire enough money to start his company along with the official recognition of his farm as its own sovereignty.  He would later release all of the information anyway while on his deathbed, leading to the country's second civil war.  He dedicated his company to being the second best at everything, by literally copying whatever the best was currently doing in any particular field.  In doing so, our company became the best at reverse engineering technology, which would come in handy later when we began recovering alien technology">
