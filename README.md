####About Us
Cabbage Corp is a pseudo-independent galactic, defense, security, espionage and advanced technologies company which produces weapons, armor, shields, reactors, drives, ships, autons, produce and various other items and devices.  We operate our own stations and refineries, and each of our devices comes with a Cabbage Corp Toolsetâ„¢ so that they can be better modified to meet your particular needs.
 
Nearly five centuries ago, our founder established The Cabbage Corporation using funds obtained through various means, most notably by blackmailing approximately fourteen US senators, thereby establishing a tradition of doing anything to anyone if it'd make a quick buck.  Our founder shared a unique ability to look past such obstacles as the boundaries of common decency, and he used his skills to make Cabbage Corp into one of the leading companies when it came to research and development.

For over 350 years, Cabbage Corp has been providing consumers with  the second-highest quality spaceships, shields, weapons and cabbages at the fourth highest prices (on average).
