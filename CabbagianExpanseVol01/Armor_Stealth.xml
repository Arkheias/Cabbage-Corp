<!--
Inherent Armor Resistivities
Armor Level		Immunity gained
6				blinding immuity
7				radiation immunity
9				EMP immunity
11				device damage immunity

These values are hard-coded in the game and do not need to be listed for armor above the given level.

I have decided based on a whim to have this stealth armor sorted such that the quadruple layered versions come after the double layered versions which come after the single layered versions.
